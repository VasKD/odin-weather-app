# Nimbus ⛅
## About 
Nimbus is a weather application that fetches data from the Visual Crossing API. The information is then displayed using original icons created just for this project. This project was developed as part of the Odin Project curriculum and it focuses on the following: 
- Utlizing the Visual Crossing API
- Modular based code 
- Async / Await functions

## Features ✨
Nimbus provides users with real-time weather information for any city of their choosing. A five-day weather forecast is also displayed below the current conditions of that location.
